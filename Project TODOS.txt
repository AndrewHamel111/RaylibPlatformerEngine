Project TODOS Sept. 2021

-- fix program structure to fit the standard, i.e. DONE
/resources/spr , /resources/snd
/src , /src/include
/levels

-- convert cpp to c (never mind that shit employers want to see C++ not C :( oh well)

-- tune up makefile

-- include hamlib

-- create a level progression system and a menu from where to "play", "level select", "editor", "quit"
--- unify level editor / tester by making use of my Update / Draw method abstraction technique seen in microgame project
